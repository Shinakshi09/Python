'''

Syntax for For loop :

for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item

We start with a keyword 'for' and give a name of a single item . We use keyword 'in' and the list we want to 
loop through. 

'''

Planets = ['Mars', 'Saturn', 'Jupyter', 'Earth']

for anything in Planets:
    print(anything)

'''

So What does this for loop is doing 

taking the elements of the list and assigning a variable name 'anything' to elements on each runs. For the first time. It runs Planets = Mars,

second time it runs Planets = 'Saturn' etc...

We can execute a whole  block of the code.
